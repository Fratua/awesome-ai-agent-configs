# Contributing to Awesome AI Agent Configs

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This list aims to be the most comprehensive, high-quality collection of AI agent configuration resources on the internet.

## How to Add a Resource

### Option 1: Pull Request (Preferred)

1. **Fork** this repository
2. **Add your resource** to the appropriate section in `README.md`
3. **Follow the format**: `- **[Name](URL)** — One-line description. What makes it useful for agent configuration.`
4. **Submit a PR** with a clear title like `Add [Resource Name] to [Section]`

### Option 2: Issue

[Open an issue](https://github.com/sovereign-skills/awesome-ai-agent-configs/issues/new?template=add-resource.md) using the "Add Resource" template.

## Quality Standards

Resources must meet **all** of the following:

- ✅ **Relevant** — Directly related to AI agent configuration, skills, memory, or tooling
- ✅ **Active** — Maintained and functional (no dead links, abandoned projects)
- ✅ **Useful** — Provides genuine value to someone building or configuring AI agents
- ✅ **Accessible** — Has documentation or is self-explanatory. Paywalled content must be clearly marked.

Resources will be **rejected** if they are:

- ❌ Generic AI/LLM content with no agent-specific angle
- ❌ Abandoned or unmaintained (no updates in 12+ months with no stable release)
- ❌ Pure marketing with no substantive content
- ❌ Duplicates of existing entries

## Formatting Rules

1. **Alphabetical order** within each section (except where editorial priority is indicated)
2. **One resource per line** — use the standard format: `- **[Name](URL)** — Description.`
3. **Descriptions are required** — No bare links. Explain what it is and why it matters.
4. **Keep descriptions concise** — One to two sentences max.
5. **Use sentence case** for descriptions
6. **End descriptions with a period**

## Adding a New Section

If you think a new category is needed:

1. Open an issue first to discuss it
2. New sections need at least **3 resources** to justify creation
3. Include a clear one-line description of what belongs in the section
