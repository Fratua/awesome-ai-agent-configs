## What Are AI Agent Configs?

Modern AI agents aren't just prompts. They're configured through structured files that define their identity, capabilities, memory, and behavior. This paradigm shift — from "prompt engineering" to **agent configuration** — is how production-grade autonomous agents actually work.

The core configuration files:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **AGENTS.md** | Operating instructions — the agent's cognitive architecture, workflows, and decision-making protocols |
| **SOUL.md** | Identity and personality — values, communication style, boundaries, and character |
| **MEMORY.md** | Persistent knowledge — what the agent remembers across sessions, learned patterns, operator context |
| **SKILL.md** | Capability definitions — reusable workflows the agent can execute, with triggers and edge cases |
| **USER.md** | Operator profile — preferences, expertise level, and working context |
| **HEARTBEAT.md** | Autonomous schedules — background tasks, monitoring duties, and periodic actions |
| **TOOLS.md** | Tool registry — available capabilities, usage patterns, and environment details |

These files create agents that are **persistent**, **self-improving**, and **deeply personalized** — far beyond what a single system prompt can achieve.
